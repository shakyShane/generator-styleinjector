# Generator-styleinjector

A live-reload alternative that works all the way back to IE7

*WARNING - NOT STABLE*

This is a 0.0.1 version of an idea I had to build a live-reload alternative that uses socket.io to enable support to old
versions of IE. It requires some manual steps and for some scripts to be added to your pages. Get it working though,
and you'll have style-injecting into a virtual machine/any computer on your network.

Until I get this packaged up properly and tested across platforms, feel free to contact me and I'll help you get started.

## Getting started
- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-styleinjector`
- Run: `yo styleinjector`
